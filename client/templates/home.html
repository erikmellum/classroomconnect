     <h2><b>About Mrs. Mellum</b></h2>
      <img src="img/us.png" class="usImage"></p>
     <p>I'm a 7th grade teacher at STREAM Charter School located in Oroville, CA. I'm originally from Chico, CA where I graduated from Chico State with my bachelor's in psychology in May 2013.  Soon after graduating, I decided I wanted to pursue a career in education. I went back to Chico State where I graduated with my credential and master's in education. I've always loved learning, <img src="http://images.singletracks.com/2010/07/IMG_1115-0.jpg" class="flumesImage">and I love teaching because I  get to share my passion for learning with my students. I spent this past summer working at a science camp in the Bay Area. I learned a ton, but I am <u>super</u> glad to be back home!</p><p>I am the youngest of three (with two older brothers). I'm also have three energetic nephews and one beautiful niece. When I'm not teaching, I love being outside! Whether it's hiking in Upper Park, or taking a trip to the flumes in Paradise (pictured right), <img src="img/jessye.png" class="jessyeImage">I enjoy being active and going on new adventures. While I don't have any kids,  I do have the cutest yellow lab in the entire world (pictured bottom-left) &#9786;.  In addition, I'm a very thrifty person; I love finding super great deals at garage sales! I also love reading and taking pictures.</p>
    
 

    <h2><b>A word about the website</b></h2>
    <p>This website has truly been a labor of love. I began develpoping the website (with the help of my husband) the July before school started and it's still a work in progress. I wanted to develop a tool that can be a resource for students (as well as parents) both in and out of the classroom. My hope is that my students come to view this website as an invaluable tool. This is a place where students can look at assignments and weekly news, but I hope that this website will also be a channel in which students are able collaborate and communicate more effectively with one another.</p>
