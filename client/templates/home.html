        <p class="lead">I'm so glad you're here. I'm Mrs. Mellum, and this is our classroom website! I encourage you to click around and explore&#9786;. Click my email address  (located at the bottom of every page) to send me a message.</p>
     <h2><b>About Mrs. Mellum</b></h2>
      <img src="img/us.png" class="usImage"></p>
     <p>I'm a 7th grade teacher at STREAM Charter School located in Oroville, CA. I'm originally from Chico, CA where I graduated from Chico State with my bachelor's in psychology in May 2013.  Soon after graduating, I decided I wanted to pursue a career in education. I went back to Chico State where I graduated with my teaching credential as well as a master's in education. I've always loved learning, <img src="http://images.singletracks.com/2010/07/IMG_1115-0.jpg" class="flumesImage">and I love teaching because I  get to share my passion for learning with my students. I spent this past summer working at a science camp in the Bay Area. I learned a ton, but I am <u>super</u> glad to be back home!</p><p>I am the youngest of three (with two older brothers). I also have three energetic nephews and one beautiful niece. When I'm not teaching, I love being outside! Whether it's hiking in Upper Park, or taking a trip to the flumes in Paradise (pictured right), <img src="img/jessye.jpeg" class="jessyeImage">I enjoy being active and going on new adventures. While I don't have any kids,  I do have the cutest yellow lab in the entire world &#9786; (pictured bottom-left).  In addition, I'm a very thrifty person; I love finding super great deals at garage sales! I also love reading and taking pictures.</p>



    <h2><b>A word about the website</b></h2>
    <p>This website has truly been a labor of love. I began developing the website (with the help of my husband) in July, before school started, and it's definitely still a work in progress. I wanted to develop a tool that can be a resource for students (as well as parents) both inside and outside the classroom. I hope this website will also be a channel in which students are able collaborate and communicate more effectively with one another.</p>
