  <p>This is the assignments page; here you will find (extremely helpful) information about all upcoming assignments. You can search for assignments by name, or you can filter assignments by subject.  Some assignments may also have a download icon in the upper right corner. This means there is additional content that you will need in order to complete the assignment. You may download the additional content by clicking on the download icon. As always, please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.</p>
